## How to Interact

- Click anywhere to start the music loop.
- Press and hold the mouse to enter **Cyber Mode**:
  -  black background dove particles appear.
  - A sci-fi-style **speed sound** will play.
  - Animated ellipses will respond to audio **frequency** and **amplitude**.
- Release the mouse to return to **Normal Mode**.
- Move the mouse slowly near the dove to trigger soft "explosion" effects in Normal Mode.

## My Individual Animation Approach

I chose to animate the dove image using a **dual-mode system**:
- **Normal Mode**: A calm, interactive dot field that reacts gently to mouse movement.
- **Cyber Mode**: A bold transformation using green particle effects, speed sound, and ellipse bursts driven by sound input.

## Animation Driver

I chose to drive my animation primarily using **audio**, both **amplitude** and **frequency spectrum**, with interaction (mouse press) as a trigger for switching modes.

## Animated Properties

- **Amplitude (Volume)**: Drives the pulsing size of various ellipse shapes scattered across the canvas.
- **Frequency (FFT)**: Generates multiple orbiting circles with reactive size and position based on different frequency bins.
- **Mouse Interaction**: Triggers a transformation from peaceful to cyber-themed visuals with a speed sound effect.
- Compared to my group members:
  - One focused on color transitions with Perlin noise.
  - Another revealed components sequentially based on time.
  - My work uniquely emphasizes **audio reactivity** and **mode switching**.

  ## Inspiration

I was inspired by:
- Cyberpunk aesthetics and music visualizers.
- Retro-style sci-fi UI and glitch effects.
